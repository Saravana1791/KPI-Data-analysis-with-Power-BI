KPI Analysis
Data received from the user is first processed using Power BI, which includes steps like data modeling and extraction. Power Query is then utilized to transform and transfer the data, ensuring it is in the right format for analysis. Once the data is prepared, it is visualized through the Power BI visualization pane, allowing users to interpret the data easily. This process helps in making informed decisions by presenting the data in a clear, accessible format that simplifies analysis and supports data-driven decision-making
